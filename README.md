# Teja NirmanAI

Teja NirmanAI is a construction tools and services web application concept designed to support people building their homes easily. It helps estimate construction costs, hire labourers, locate nearby shops for materials, and explore tools for rent or buy. It also includes an AI chatbot demo using Together.ai for instant guidance (currently works locally).

## Overview

This project aims to empower users without technical knowledge to estimate their home construction cost, understand required materials, hire workers quickly, and plan confidently.

## Key Features

- **Estimator:** Calculate approximate construction costs based on area input (main theme feature).
- **Worker Hiring:** Homeowners can find labourers, and labourers can find work opportunities nearby.
- **Shop Locator:** Shows nearest shops for construction materials, making procurement easy.
- **Tools Booking:** Explore modern tools needed for construction, available for rent or buy.
- **AI Chatbot:** Integrated AI assistant (Together.ai) for quick answers and guidance. *Currently works locally only.*

## Project Status

- **Frontend:** Completed and hosted live as a demo on GitHub Pages.
- **Backend:** Developed (Flask + Together.ai) and working locally, pending live deployment due to free cloud limitations.

## Future Development Goals

- Deploy backend using Google Cloud or Render for a live AI assistant.
- Integrate UPI payment gateway for tool bookings and worker payments.
- Extend estimator to calculate detailed cement, rod, sand, bricks quantity with current market rates.
- Enable voice-based AI assistant for accessibility.
- Allow workers to get live notifications of nearby work requests.
