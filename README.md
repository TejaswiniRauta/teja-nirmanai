Teja NirmanAI

Teja NirmanAI is a modern web-based platform designed to make home construction easier and smarter, especially for people with little technical knowledge about construction.

What it does

- Estimate home construction costs: Users can enter their area in square feet and get an estimated budget for their house construction.
- Know required materials: Automatically calculates the approximate quantities of cement, rods, bricks, sand, and other materials needed (feature under development).
- Hire workers easily: Connects homeowners with nearby skilled labourers for construction work.
- Find nearby shops: Shows nearby shops to buy construction materials easily.
- Tools for rent or buy: Explore modern tools required for construction and either rent or buy them directly.
- AI chatbot assistant: Integrated AI chatbot (Together.ai based) to guide users with their queries about construction, materials, and cost estimation. (Currently works locally, not deployed live due to free hosting limits.)

Project Status

- Frontend: Completed and hosted on GitHub Pages as a demo.
- Backend: Developed in Flask (Together.ai integration working locally), pending deployment to cloud for public usage.
- Estimator: Basic estimator ready; future upgrade will calculate today’s exact market rates for each material.

Future Development Goals

- Deploy backend on Google Cloud or Render
- Integrate UPI payment gateway for tool bookings and worker payments
- Enable voice-based AI assistant
- Live notification system for workers about nearby work
- Exact material calculator (cement, rod, brick) based on real-time rates
