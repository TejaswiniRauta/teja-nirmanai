Teja NirmanAI
Teja NirmanAI is a simple web app concept designed to help people in construction estimate costs, hire workers easily, locate nearby shops for materials, and explore tools for rent or buy. It also includes a basic AI chatbot integration demo (backend not yet deployed).

Overview
This project aims to support people who do not have technical knowledge about construction but want to estimate their house construction costs, know required materials, and hire labourers quickly.

Key Features
Home construction cost estimator based on area input

Worker hiring system to connect labourers with homeowners

Nearby shop locator for construction materials

Tools booking (rent/buy) for modern construction tools

Integrated AI assistant (using Together.ai) for instant guidance (currently works locally, not deployed)

Project Status
The frontend is fully designed and hosted on GitHub Pages as a live demo.
Backend (Flask + Together.ai integration) is working locally but not deployed live due to free hosting limitations.

Future Development Goals
Deploy backend on Google Cloud or Render for live AI chatbot

Integrate UPI payment gateway for tool booking and worker payments

Extend estimator to calculate exact quantity of cement, rods, sand, bricks, and overall budget in today's rates

Add voice-based AI assistant for easier accessibility

Enable workers to get live notifications of nearby work requests
